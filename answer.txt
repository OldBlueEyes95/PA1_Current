# Time measurements

Measurements made on a Ubuntu VM on my Windows laptop.

Transfer of files went as following (chart included as minutes_per_byte.png)
Bytes | Time (s)
----- | ---
1     | 0.63
10    | 0.95
100   | 0.58
1k    | 0.50
10k   | 0.78
100k  | 0.86
1m    | 4.73
10m   | 13.52
100m  | 1:14.86

Times were trivial for low values, but this surprisingly persisted even up to a hundred thousand bytes (far past when a single buffer could be used). 
Reads are usually cheaper than writes, so the file write (fstream was what I chose) is probably the bottleneck.
Some quick research shows that an L1 cache is around 64KB and an L2 around 256KB, and given where the slowdown began it's possible that cache size may have played a factor.
